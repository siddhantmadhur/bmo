# BMO

### Motivation

I wanted to create a responsive front-end experience using Golang and HTML templates, and although there were tools like Air that would allow live reloading, there wasn't anything available like Vite for this specific use case

### What does it do?

It builds a webserver for any framework you can imagine, runs it and creates a proxy server for you, the developer, to use. This proxy server automatically refreshes the page when it detects a new update for the user. 



### How to use

```
bmo init
``` 
This command will create a .bmo.toml file for you to modify
